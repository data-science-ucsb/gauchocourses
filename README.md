# GauchoCourses

Data Science UCSB's GauchoCourses application is a quarterly course planner that allows students to see possible schedule combinations for the classes they want to take, and save them for when their pass times come around.

See [the Wiki](https://github.com/data-science-ucsb/gauchocourses/wiki) for contribution instructions and reference information. The [backend](backend/) and [frontend](frontend/) directories have their own respective README's with more information.
